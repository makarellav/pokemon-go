# Areas for improvement:

---

## Main

- [ ] Refactor the app. For now it's a mess but it works :)
- [ ] Consider using [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) to create a beautiful TUI
- [ ] Update the CLI to support the "up" arrow to cycle through previous commands

## Optional
- [ ] Simulate battles between pokemons
- [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] Keep pokemon in a "party" and allow them to level up
- [ ] Allow for pokemon that are caught to evolve after a set amount of time
- [ ] Persist a user's Pokedex so they can save progress between sessions
- [ ] Use the PokeAPI to make exploration more interesting. For example, rather than typing the names of areas, maybe you are given choices of areas and just type "left" or "right"
- [ ] Random encounters with wild pokemon
- [ ] Adding support for different types of balls (Pokeballs, Great Balls, Ultra Balls, etc), which have different chances of catching pokemon
